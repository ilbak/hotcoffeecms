# hotcoffeecms
Hot Coffee is a simple CMS written in PHP that does not require any additional element occupies only 4 kb.

Engaging directly with the models in HTML, allows you to quickly create a website compatible with all standard HTML and CSS.

---
# Getting start...

- Upload the hotcoffeecms.php and index.php file to your web space
- Open index.php from the browser and your site will be active.

The first page that will be created automatically will be called "Home" and will be contained in the "Home.php" file.
Change your home file to your liking and create a php file for each page that will make up your new site.

# Site structure

The structure of the site is designed in a minimalist way:
The file hotcoffeecms.php, index.php and Home.php will be in the main directory and every new PHP file in the folder will be counted by the CMS as a new page and automatically listed in the navigation bar.

If you want to create secondary, unlisted pages, add the "-none.php" suffix to the page file name. For example: "Contact.php" will be listed in the navigation bar, renaming it to "Contact-none.php" will not be listed.

# Widget
The php files with the suffix "-sx.php" (left) and "-dx.php" (right) are loaded as a widget on the sides of the page.

---
# Templates
Hot Coffee CMS can be integrated into any theme, including the "hotcoffeecms.php" file in the "index.php" file that sets the theme.
You can use the "index.php" file on the Hot Coffee CMS website and modify it for your needs or learn how to include the CMS in other themes.
The "index.php" that you find already contains everything you need to set up your site, change the title, the colors and you're done!
